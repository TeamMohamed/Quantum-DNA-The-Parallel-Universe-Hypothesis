📄 Quantum DNA & The Parallel Universe Hypothesis

This work explores the intersection of Quantum Biology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Parallel Universe Theories, analyzing whether DNA functions as a quantum information processor. Using AI-driven quantum analysis, this research investigates quantum coherence, entanglement, photon emissions, and multi-dimensional genetic encoding.

📖 Abstract
🧪 Does DNA operate as a quantum system?
This research applies AI-driven quantum analysis to DNA structures, investigating non-classical properties such as quantum coherence, entanglement, and resonance-based effects. Inspired by the works of Schrödinger, Bohm, Bell, Penrose, and Tesla, this study integrates AI deep learning, Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, and quantum neural networks (QNNs) to analyze DNA at a quantum level.

🔍 Key Research Questions:
1️⃣ Can DNA exhibit quantum entanglement across strands?
2️⃣ Do AI models detect structured biophoton emissions from DNA?
3️⃣ Does Tesla’s 3-6-9 resonance influence DNA stability?
4️⃣ Can quantum probability explain DNA mutations?
5️⃣ Could DNA function across parallel universes?

📌 Key Findings
✔ Quantum DNA Entanglement – Spin-state tracking confirms potential entanglement
✔ AI-Predicted Photon Emission – DNA biophotons exhibit structured quantum signals
✔ Tesla 3-6-9 Resonance Impact – Certain frequencies enhance DNA stability
✔ Quantum Probability of DNA Mutations – AI-predicted probabilities align with real-world mutations
✔ Parallel Universe Implications – AI simulations suggest quantum wave persistence
