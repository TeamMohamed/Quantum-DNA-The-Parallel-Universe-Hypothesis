📄 *Quantum DNA & The Parallel Universe Hypothesis*

This work explores the intersection of Quantum Biology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Parallel Universe Theories, analyzing whether DNA functions as a quantum information processor. Using AI-driven quantum analysis, this research investigates quantum coherence, entanglement, photon emissions, and multi-dimensional genetic encoding.

## 📖 Abstract  
**Does DNA operate as a quantum system?**  
This research applies AI-driven quantum analysis to DNA structures, investigating non-classical properties such as quantum coherence, entanglement, and resonance-based effects. Inspired by Schrödinger, Bohm, Bell, Penrose, and Tesla, this study integrates deep learning, Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) to model DNA at a quantum level.

## 🔍 Key Research Questions:
1. Can DNA exhibit quantum entanglement across strands?  
2. Do AI models detect structured biophoton emissions from DNA?  
3. Does Tesla’s 3-6-9 resonance influence DNA stability?  
4. Can quantum probability explain DNA mutations?  
5. Could DNA function across parallel universes?
